# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
## modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
## note before you use
The scripts that are used in my version of dwmblocks need to be downloaded seperately.
