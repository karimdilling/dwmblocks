# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
## Modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
## Note before you use
The scripts that are used in my version of dwmblocks need to be downloaded seperately. You can get them in my [statusbar](https://github.com/karimdilling/statusbar)-repository
## Guide on how to use
A guide on how to use dwmblocks can be found [here](https://www.distrotube.com/blog/dwmblocks-guide/).
